<p>The title character, <a href="#Red_Green">Red Green</a> (<a href="/wiki/Steve_Smith_(comedian)" title="Steve Smith (comedian)">Steve Smith</a>), is a handyman who tries to find shortcuts to most of his projects, trusting most of his work to <a href="/wiki/Duct_tape" title="Duct tape">duct tape</a>, which he calls "the handyman's secret weapon". He is the president of the Possum Lodge, a <a href="/wiki/Fiction" title="Fiction">fictional</a> men's club in the small <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_Ontario" title="Northwestern Ontario">northwestern Ontario</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Possum_Lake" title="Possum Lake">Possum Lake</a>, near the also-fictional town of <a href="/wiki/Port_Asbestos" class="mw-redirect" title="Port Asbestos">Port Asbestos</a>. He and his fellow lodge members had their own TV show in which they gave lessons and demonstrations in repair work and outdoor activities, and advice for men.</p>

<p>The show's basic concept was that of a <a href="/wiki/Cable_TV" class="mw-redirect" title="Cable TV">cable TV</a> show, taped in part on a hand-held camera by Red's nephew Harold. The show's structure evolved over time and included several regular segments that appeared in almost every episode. These segments were interspersed with each episode's three main plot segments. The most frequent segments were "The Possum Lodge Word Game", "Handyman Corner", and "Adventures with Bill".</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Handyman_Corner">Handyman Corner</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Handyman Corner">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Red attempted to demonstrate creative and often humorous ways to tackle relatively common tasks, such as taking out the trash or making use of derelict cars, or to create something extravagant out of whatever he could get his hands on.

<p>Structured like <i><a href="/wiki/Password_(game_show)" title="Password (game show)">Password</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Pyramid_(game_show)" title="Pyramid (game show)">Pyramid</a></i>, the objective was to get a contestant to say a certain word in 30 seconds by giving them various clues. On this program however, the contestant almost always gave answers that were either way off or very odd throughout the segment, but finally said the correct word by accident. Often Harold (or whoever was hosting the game) would announce that week's prize in a misleading way, to make it sound much more interesting.</p>

<p>In earlier episodes, Red often recited small bits of <a href="/wiki/Poetry" title="Poetry">poetry</a> in the woods. The segments were named depending on the season and had a humorous twist on a famous saying. For example, the winter segment is named "<a href="/wiki/The_Winter_of_Our_Discontent" title="The Winter of Our Discontent">Winter of Our Discount Tent</a>".</p>
<p>In many shows, Red and Harold could be seen sitting at a <a href="/wiki/Campfire" title="Campfire">campfire</a>, with Red usually strumming a <a href="/wiki/Guitar" title="Guitar">guitar</a> and singing an original humorous song with Harold providing vocal accents and percussion with various items such as spoons, gas cans and junk metal.

<p>A regular segment where Harold would read a letter supposedly from a viewer and Red would answer it, often misinterpreting what the viewer was asking. This evolved into "The Experts", where Red and another character answer alleged letters from viewers and always give ridiculous advice, often debating on what the viewer meant or needed.</p>
<p>"The Experts" was always introduced with one of the lodge members (usually Mike, Dalton, or Winston) saying, "Welcome to 'The Experts' portion of the show where we examine those three little words men find so hard to say..." The audience, in front of which the show was filmed, would then chant in unison, "I DON'T KNOW!"</p>

<p>Hap Shaughnessy appeared in many segments and always told outlandish stories about his life to Red and occasionally another character, who would doubt Hap's claims and start making jokes about them.

<p>The show usually concluded with Red giving a message to his wife, Bernice (usually a <a href="/wiki/Double_entendre" title="Double entendre">double entendre</a>), and delivering his signature piece of life advice in the form of a hockey metaphor: "Keep your stick on the ice." This was followed by a general meeting of the Possum Lodge membership while the credits rolled, which began with the ritual stating of the Lodge motto: <i>"Quando omni flunkus moritati"</i> (<a href="/wiki/Pseudo-Latin" class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudo-Latin">Pseudo-Latin</a> for "When all else fails, play dead"). From season six onward, this was often followed by the Man's Prayer: "I'm a man, but I can change, if I have to, I guess." In the final episode of the series, a revised version of the prayer was said: "I'm a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh well." Steve Smith later identified that this was a tribute to his wife Morag, who had simply commented, "Oh well," upon viewing the first episode back in 1991. In one episode, women take over Possum Lodge and change the prayer to "<a href="/wiki/I_am_woman" class="mw-redirect" title="I am woman">I am woman, hear me roar</a>. I'm in charge, get over it."</p>

Steve Smith as Red Green</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Smith originally created the character of Red Green for his 1979–1985 sketch comedy series <i><a href="/wiki/Smith_%26_Smith" title="Smith &amp; Smith">Smith &amp; Smith</a></i>. The sketch was a parody of the long-running Canadian outdoors show <i><a href="/wiki/The_Red_Fisher_Show" title="The Red Fisher Show">The Red Fisher Show</a></i> (1968–1989), starring <a href="/wiki/B.H._%22Red%22_Fisher" class="mw-redirect" title="B.H. &quot;Red&quot; Fisher">BH "Red" Fisher</a>, in which Red and his friends would show silent films of their fishing trips with commentary at "Scuttlebutt Lodge". The character also appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Me_%26_Max" title="Me &amp; Max">Me &amp; Max</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Comedy_Mill" title="The Comedy Mill">The Comedy Mill</a></i> before becoming the focus of his own series.</p>
<p><i>The Red Green Show</i> was produced first by <a href="/wiki/CHCH-DT" title="CHCH-DT">CHCH-TV</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, then by <a href="/wiki/CFPL-DT" title="CFPL-DT">CFPL-TV</a> in <a href="/wiki/London,_Ontario" title="London, Ontario">London</a>, and then by the <a href="/wiki/Global_Television_Network" title="Global Television Network">Global Television Network</a>, before finally finding its permanent home at <a href="/wiki/CBC_Television" title="CBC Television">CBC Television</a> for the 1997 season (its seventh) onward. The show was renamed <i>The New Red Green Show</i> upon its move to Global, and would keep this title until its second season at CBC.</p>
<p>The show ended 7 April 2006 after its 15th season with exactly 300 episodes. (This longevity inspired a joke in one episode, where Red says "The question is, can you do anything with crap? Obviously the answer is yes, we're in our fourteenth season.")</p>
<p>The last episode was filmed on 5 November 2005, at the Showline Studios Harbourside location. At the time the season began taping, the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> locked out staffers who were members of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Media_Guild" title="Canadian Media Guild">Canadian Media Guild</a>, rendering the show's regular studios at the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Centre" title="Canadian Broadcasting Centre">Canadian Broadcasting Centre</a> unavailable.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The last episode concluded with the show breaking the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> by thanking the audience and fans for their popularity. In addition, the Man's Prayer was changed to "I'm a man / but I changed / because I had to / Oh, well."</p>
<p>The low-budget movie <i><a href="/wiki/Duct_Tape_Forever" title="Duct Tape Forever">Duct Tape Forever</a></i> (2002), was based on <i>The Red Green Show</i>. It was screened in select American theaters, but did not receive a wide release. It has since appeared occasionally on <a href="/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" class="mw-redirect" title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a> stations during pledge drives. It is also available on DVD.</p>
<p>As the show gained popularity, Steve Smith also wrote a syndicated newspaper column, as Red Green, titled <i>North of 40</i> in which he would give advice to readers.</p>
<p>In previous years, the show would stage live mini-telethons (sometimes called "<i>Red Green</i>-a-thons") for public television stations in the United States. These usually coincided with national PBS fundraising drives, and featured contests between various PBS stations carrying the show. This was done to encourage new stations to carry Red Green, for those who already have it to continue it, and in one year Red playfully dumped stations that chose to discontinue the show in a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Red Green has been the "Ambassador of Scotch Duct Tape" for <a href="/wiki/3M" title="3M">3M</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On 14 December 2008, a retrospective special title "The Red Green Story-We're All In This Together" aired on select PBS stations. The special was released on DVD along with a book. Also, despite stating after the show's final episode that he planned to permanently retire his character,<sup id="cite_ref-journalpioneer_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-journalpioneer-3">[3]</a></sup> in 2010, Smith embarked on the "Wit and Wisdom Comedy Tour", in which he gave live performances as Red Green in cities across the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>On 29 November 2012, Steve Smith announced a new "How To Do Everything" Tour which kicks off in Canada in the fall of 2013 before going to the US in the spring of 2014. The 2016 North American tour, "I'm Not Old, I'm Ripe", begins in March and is scheduled to conclude in May, with stops in 25 US cities.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

Some of the characters that appeared during the 2004 season of the show.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The title character of <i>The Red Green Show</i>, Red (<a href="/wiki/Steve_Smith_(comedian)" title="Steve Smith (comedian)">Steve Smith</a>) is the leader of Possum Lodge and a self-proclaimed handyman who is constantly extolling the virtues of <a href="/wiki/Duct_tape" title="Duct tape">duct tape</a> ("the handyman's secret weapon"). He is married to Bernice Green and does not have any children. He is seldom seen without his trademark red-and-green suspenders and Canadian military field maneuvers cap.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Red's DVD biography, Red became the leader of Possum Lodge after gradually becoming more involved with it over time and becoming "the only guy nobody hated." At one point, he borrowed a large sum of money from his brother just before his brother lost his job at the bank. In repayment, Red employed his nephew Harold as the producer and director of <i>The Red Green Show</i>.</p>
<p>In addition to being a handyman, Red also has several main philosophies in life, some of which are passed on to the lodge as a whole. Chief among them is the phrase "Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati" (pseudo-Latin for "When all else fails, play dead"). He also concludes each of his Handyman Corner segments with the phrase, "If the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy."</p>
<p>Red owns what is known as "the Possum Van", a 1979–1993 <a href="/wiki/Dodge_Ram_Van" title="Dodge Ram Van">Dodge Ram cargo van</a>, painted as a grey <a href="/wiki/Opossum" title="Opossum">'possum</a> on a pale blue background, and with a license plate reading simply "POSSUM". It is one of Red's few vehicles that actually runs. It has played (and donated) many parts in <b>Handyman's Corner</b> projects. After the series ended, the van was scrapped.</p>
<p>Red's dry, often sarcastic wit is balanced by a strong sense of camaraderie with his fellow lodge members, partly because he directs most of his sarcasm toward Harold. Despite this, Harold and the rest of Possum Lodge seem to regard Red with a high level of respect, though occasionally some of the lodge members will challenge his authority in one way or another.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Harold_Green">Harold Green</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: Harold Green">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Harold (<a href="/wiki/Patrick_McKenna" title="Patrick McKenna">Patrick McKenna</a>) is Red's nephew and the fictional producer and director of <i>The Red Green Show</i>. He is a <a href="/wiki/Nerd" title="Nerd">nerd</a>—he has a significant <a href="/wiki/Overbite" title="Overbite">overbite</a>, wears thick glasses, is very eager and sensitive. He is often appalled by the behaviour of the other lodge members (and even Red himself), and he puts a lot of effort into trying to change everyone's behaviour, usually with little or no success.</p>
<p>Harold's advanced knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>, television and technology originally landed him the job of producer and director of the TV show, often wielding a portable device with dials and a keyboard, used to create the show's visual effects and transitions, though he didn't have it in later seasons. Later in the show's history, he became employed at Multicorp and went to work in the neighbouring town of Port Asbestos. He later became the publicity manager for Possum Lake, and eventually fell in love with Bonnie (<a href="/wiki/Laurie_Elliott" title="Laurie Elliott">Laurie Elliott</a>), a commercial truck driver who shares nearly all of his unusual mannerisms. The two were married in the final episode of the series.</p>
<p>Harold and Red spend much of their time on the show trading insults and poking fun at each other. While they have shown they can cooperate with one another at times, Harold is often very critical of Red's ideas and schemes, but usually ends up going along with them anyway.</p>
<p>In the film <i>Duct Tape Forever</i>, Harold is not a member of the Possum Lodge. At the end, the brotherhood accept him and take him in.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dalton_Humphrey">Dalton Humphrey</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: Dalton Humphrey">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Dalton (<a href="/wiki/Bob_Bainborough" title="Bob Bainborough">Bob Bainborough</a>) is the owner of Humphrey's Everything Store and is one of Red's best friends. He is one of the few financially successful lodge members. He is a cheapskate and tries to conserve money as much as possible, shortchanging and cheating people. When he isn't complaining about the state of things at his store, he generally complains about his troubled marriage to Ann Marie and their daughter's spending habits.</p>
<p>Dalton has been with the show since season 4 and takes part in the vast majority of the show's main storylines. He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations. He also takes his fatherhood very seriously, often trying to pass on his ideas and wisdom to other people (most notably Harold). He generally tells people exactly what he thinks of them, even if it means offending them.</p>
<p>Ann Marie only appeared onscreen once, in the final episode, in which she and Dalton renewed their wedding vows (her face was obscured by her bridal veil); however, she was sometimes seen in shadow in scenes set near their home (her voice was provided by <a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Irwin" title="Jennifer Irwin">Jennifer Irwin</a>). Their daughter, Tabitha, appeared in the film <i><a href="/wiki/Duct_Tape_Forever" title="Duct Tape Forever">Duct Tape Forever</a></i>, played by <a href="/wiki/Tracy_Dawson" title="Tracy Dawson">Tracy Dawson</a>, although there she goes by the name Mandy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mike_Hamar">Mike Hamar</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Mike Hamar">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Mike (<a href="/wiki/Wayne_Robson" title="Wayne Robson">Wayne Robson</a>) is a career criminal who joined Possum Lodge while on parole from federal prison. He has become another of Red's best friends and often tries to help out around the Lodge, though he is not very good at handyman tasks in general. He talks a lot about his troubled childhood — mostly about his mother (an <a href="/wiki/Exotic_dancer" class="mw-redirect" title="Exotic dancer">exotic dancer</a>) and many "fathers". Mike suffers from low self-esteem and poor planning, usually causing those around him to try to cheer him up again. He is the only character who regularly refers to Red as "Mr. Green." As revealed in the final episode, Mike eventually becomes a police officer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Winston_Rothschild_III">Winston Rothschild III</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Winston Rothschild III">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Winston (<a href="/wiki/Jeff_Lumby" title="Jeff Lumby">Jeff Lumby</a>) is the owner and sole employee of Rothschild's Sewage and Septic Sucking Services. Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is always seen wearing a <a href="/wiki/Hard_hat" title="Hard hat">hard hat</a>, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able to look on the bright side of things even in the face of certain disaster. He is also a fan of <a href="/wiki/Self_help" class="mw-redirect" title="Self help">self help</a> speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.</p>
<p>A true entrepreneur, Winston describes sewage and septic sucking as his lifelong dream. He owns his own equipment and a septic truck—apparently his only means of transportation, even on his usually unsuccessful dates. Throughout the series, he appears in a wide variety of commercials advertising his septic sucking business, almost always with a humorous quip ("We're number one in the number two business"; "We'll take that smell off your hands";"We come in a truck and leave in a day" etc.). In later episodes, his commercials tend to parody the advertising campaigns of numerous Canadian companies.</p>
<p>He also has a tendency to confuse certain phrases and adages, saying things like "<a href="/wiki/Significant_Other" title="Significant Other">Significant Mother</a>" or "<a href="/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)" title="Catch-22 (logic)">Catch-23</a>".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bill_Smith">Bill Smith</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: Bill Smith">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Bill (<a href="/wiki/Rick_Green" title="Rick Green">Rick Green</a>) is the star of the "Adventures with Bill" segment, in which he and at least one other character (usually Red) attempt to perform relatively simple tasks or try a sport or game in the clumsiest, most accident-prone way possible. (These segments are done in a silent home-movie format with a voiceover by Red.) Bill rarely actually speaks, and has only appeared on the main set of the show in the second season (still silently) and in the series' final episode—these are also the only times Bill is ever seen in colour (though he shows up in color at the end of the credits sequence for the first season, at least), since the "Adventures" segments are shown in black &amp; white. When something goes wrong, as it invariably does each episode, Bill can be heard as a muffled scream; these are anticipation of injury, not actual injury, such as Bill screaming as he falls off the ladder, not when he hits the ground. In some segments, Bill can be heard speaking in gibberish, but the explanation for not hearing him clearly is usually that the camera they use for these segments has a weak microphone. Later in the show's history, the "Adventures with Bill" segment was expanded to include more characters and not necessarily Bill himself.</p>
<p>In each "Adventures" segment in which Bill appears, he usually attempts to do something of an outdoors nature, such as backpacking, building something, chopping down a tree, or playing a sport. Each of his actions are basically slapstick comedy routines—for example, when he swings an axe, it flies out of his hands and smashes into another character or Red's Possum Van. In what has become a classic occurrence, Bill often manages to knock one or both of the side mirrors off the van. He can also store large tools and miscellaneous items in his overalls, and <a href="/wiki/Hammerspace" title="Hammerspace">pull them out</a> on demand. Many segments show Bill getting hurt somehow, but apparently not seriously or permanently. (One segment in particular ends with Bill's arms crushed and flattened in a grape press.) There is generally no continuity from one "Adventures" segment to the next, and Bill comes back in the following episode good as new.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ranger_Gord">Ranger Gord</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22" title="Edit section: Ranger Gord">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Ranger Gord (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Keleghan" title="Peter Keleghan">Peter Keleghan</a>) is the local <a href="/wiki/Forest_ranger" class="mw-redirect" title="Forest ranger">forest ranger</a> who spends almost all of his time alone in Fire Watch Tower 13 and, later in the series, Tower 3. His full name is Gordon Ranger, but he prefers not to be called "Ranger Ranger." He is always seen wearing his ranger outfit (which he apparently launders using only a blow dryer), and he finds various eccentric ways to pass his time, even while Red is visiting. For example, he has been seen making nature-sounds tapes by mimicking animal noises into a tape recorder, and he claims to use baked beans as his alarm clock. In one episode, he is found by Red to be hibernating.</p>
<p>Gord has worked in his watch tower for more than eighteen years without a paycheck and claims to have been a forest ranger his entire life. His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought <a href="/wiki/Smokey_Bear" title="Smokey Bear">Smokey Bear</a> was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only you can prevent <a href="/wiki/Forest_fire" class="mw-redirect" title="Forest fire">forest fires</a>"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits as he talks about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to have gotten so lonely that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a> <a href="/wiki/Bottle_cap" title="Bottle cap">bottle caps</a> (Gord thought that a <a href="/wiki/Budweiser_(Anheuser-Busch)" class="mw-redirect" title="Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)">Budweiser</a> cap was for being a "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that he was doing a "good job protecting the forest," to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.</p>
<p>Later in the series (seasons 9 to 13, between 1999 and 2004), Ranger Gord made a series of 23 short "educational" cartoons about the environment. Written, animated, produced, directed, and voiced by Gord himself, these films always feature an animated version of Gord as a musclebound superhero type, and Red and Harold Green make appearances as a <a href="/wiki/Opossum" title="Opossum">'possum</a> and beaver, respectively. (Dalton and Mike also appear in one short, depicted as a bear and a raccoon, respectively.) The cartoons' subjects have included finding money at the end of a rainbow, planting a cell phone to grow a telephone pole, and waging a fire fight against the sun and its deadly <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_ray" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultraviolet ray">ultraviolet rays</a>. The cartoons were actually written by staff writers starting with Shaun Graham, who wrote the six original shorts.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> All 23 shorts were designed, directed, and animated by <a href="/wiki/Bryce_Hallett" title="Bryce Hallett">Bryce Hallett</a> of Frog Feet Productions.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The original fire watch tower shown in seasons 1–2 was the treehouse in Steve Smith's backyard in <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, that he had put up for his sons.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> From seasons 3–6, it was filmed in an actual watch tower (in reality located at <a href="/wiki/Port_Carling" title="Port Carling">Port Carling</a>, Ont.). By season 8, it was a set. Gord appeared in the lodge during season 7, saying that he had eaten the front two legs of the tower and caused it to fall over. In the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Duct_Tape_Forever" title="Duct Tape Forever">Duct Tape Forever</a></i>, the tower had burned down and Ranger Gord was then in charge of a <a href="/wiki/Train_station" title="Train station">train station</a> located at the end of a section of unfinished tracks and thus where no trains ever run; this is an obvious pun on Gord's still having a "dead-end job", just like his former merely-self-maintained forest-ranger position that the National Forest Service cared nothing about.</p>

Montrose</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Red_Green_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: Edgar K. B. Montrose">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Edgar Montrose (<a href="/wiki/Graham_Greene_(actor)" title="Graham Greene (actor)">Graham Greene</a>) is Possum Lodge's explosives enthusiast. He believes that any problem (including leaky roofs and invasive weeds) can be solved with explosives. He is usually seen wearing singed overalls, a cracked construction helmet and a pair of ear protectors, though he rarely covers his ears with them. According to himself, Edgar was born in <a href="/wiki/Assiniboia,_Saskatchewan" title="Assiniboia, Saskatchewan">Assiniboia, Saskatchewan</a>, and he started using explosives at a young age. He later enlisted in the Army and was dishonourably discharged after only three weeks, when he blew up the mess hall ("turns out they were only <i>thinking</i> of building a new one").</p>
<p>Edgar's heavy use of explosives over the years has caused him to lose most of his hearing, which often leads to nonsensical responses to questions and comments. (For example, Red will ask him, "What have you brought for us today, Edgar?" and Edgar will respond, "Oh, just fine, Red.") He is also missing a finger on his left hand, though the story of how he lost it changes each time he tells it. He claims to not have many friends, and according to his DVD biography, he has "yet to meet a woman that likes to spend a Saturday night watching [him] blow a fully grown Douglas Fir tree clean over the lake."</p>
<p>Edgar's middle initials, K.B., are rumored to stand for "Ka Boom!", his favourite catchphrase. His favourite movie is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai" title="The Bridge on the River Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></i>, saying, "Did you see that baby go up at the end?" After seeing the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Dances_With_Wolves" class="mw-redirect" title="Dances With Wolves">Dances With Wolves</a></i>, Edgar thought that the "Native guy" should have received an <a href="/wiki/Oscar_award" class="mw-redirect" title="Oscar award">Oscar</a> for his role. (Greene had been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Kicking Bird in the movie, but lost to <a href="/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a>.)</p>

<p>Hap Shaughnessy (<a href="/wiki/Gordon_Pinsent" title="Gordon Pinsent">Gordon Pinsent</a>) is the water-taxi captain of Possum Lake, but he is much better known at Possum Lodge for his self-aggrandizing tall tales. In virtually every appearance he makes on the show, he makes a ridiculous claim to have been a significant person in history, or to have accomplished some incredible feat. Nobody else on the show believes him, but he will go to great lengths to tell his stories anyway. For example, he has claimed that he owns a coat that belonged to <a href="/wiki/Santa_Claus" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> himself, that he once filled in for <a href="/wiki/Keith_Richards" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stones" class="mw-redirect" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, that he once raised tigers in Kenya, had a magnetized metal plate in his head, drove the <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5" title="Aston Martin DB5">Aston Martin</a> featured in <a href="/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)" title="Goldfinger (film)">Goldfinger</a> which he used an an actual spy, and that he even died and came back to life at the <a href="/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics" title="1988 Summer Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>. In one episode, it is hinted that he lies about his past because he has a poor self-image.</p>
<p>Hap is always seen wearing a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Regiment" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal Canadian Regiment">Royal Canadian Regiment</a> baseball cap, which is a nod to Pinsent's own military service as a soldier in the Regiment during the early 1950s.</p>

He is featured on <i>The Red Green Show</i> in the "Talking Animals" segment, in which Red tries to get him to show the audience a small animal, such as a weasel or a leech. Invariably, something goes wrong and causes Ed to panic, usually bringing an abrupt and comedic end to the segment.</p>

<p>Glen Brackston (<a href="/wiki/Mark_Wilson_(comedian)" title="Mark Wilson (comedian)">Mark Wilson</a>) is the operator and only employee of Brackton's Marina. Glen is a large and incredibly lazy man, often seen sitting on his lawn chair or napping. He has suffered multiple heart attacks, and has seven daughters. In the earliest seasons, his laziness was due to his obsessive focus on his RV. Later on, he would appear with Red in the "Boating Tips" segment, where he would give advice or instructions on how to maintain and care for boats. However, he would often make Red perform these tasks for him, citing his poor health as leaving him unable to do it himself.</p>

<p>Throughout its fifteen-season run, <i>The Red Green Show</i> sported a cast of well over forty secondary and minor characters, ranging from fellow Possum Lodge members to guests making single appearances and even audience members appearing on the set. During the second season, the regular cast was expanded to include many different lodge members, none of whom were kept on for appearances after the second season. The cast, while primarily male, did include occasional female characters as well, including network executive Kelly Cook (<a href="/wiki/Stephanie_Beard" class="mw-redirect" title="Stephanie Beard">Stephanie Beard</a>) and Anne-Marie Humphrey (<a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Irwin" title="Jennifer Irwin">Jennifer Irwin</a>), Dalton's wife.</p>

<p>In addition to the already long list of characters, there are several characters who are frequently referred to, but are never seen. The most frequently mentioned are Red's friends Junior Singleton, Buster Hadfield, Moose Thompson, Stinky Peterson, and Old Man Sedgwick. The in-show descriptions of these characters are often far-fetched and outlandish, as are their actual names.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernice Green: Red's wife, whom he married without waiting for the results of the pregnancy test. Red claims they had tried to have children but after Harold was born they took that as a warning. She is often exasperated with the antics of Red and the other lodge members and often tries to encourage Red to partake in activities like the arts and eating at fine restaurants, usually to disastrous effect. In once episode she faked a love letter from one of Red's old girlfriends (which turned out to be an affectionate letter from Red's mother) and Red resolved to take Bernice out to dinner any night the episode aired to prevent her from seeing it and becoming jealous. In spite of this she and Red do seem to be close, and Red often implies they have an active sex life. Bernice has a niece named Alicia whose oral condition has earned her the nickname "Horse". At one point Harold considered marrying her out of desperation.</li>
<li>Old Man Sedgwick: Orville Lloyd Dutton Manly Alvin Norbert "Old Man" Sedgewick. Old Man Sedgwick's age is never officially disclosed, although he is reported to have known <a href="/wiki/John_A._Macdonald" title="John A. Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a> when he (John) was only a child, and in one episode, he is said to have been born "sometime in the mesozoic era". He does havea son who was 97 years of age, and his parents were still alive (his father bearing the name "Dead Man Walking Sdgewick") Sedgewick is often described as being irritable and suffering from senility, for which he takes medication.</li>
<li>Junior Singleton: An odd member of Possum Lodge. Married to his wife Noreen shortly after meeting at a tool swap, with an entire episode dedicated to preparing for his stag party. Junior is often the first to question Red's decisions or authority and at one point tried to found a rival lodge which failed. It is implied that Junior and Noreen are obese.</li>
<li>Moose Thompson: Mooseworth Hugo Largess "Moose" Thompson is an extremely overweight member of the lodge. He is implied to be rather dim-witted, saying that he thought his nickname made him sound stupid, so he considered changing it to "Moose Johnson".</li>
<li>Stinky Peterson: Stephen Riechen Puanteur "Stinky" Peterson has a pronounced stench and appalling personal habits. At one point Harold wondered if the scent was dangerous or toxic, which Red assured him was not the case because the lodge members keep <a href="/wiki/Domestic_Canary" class="mw-redirect" title="Domestic Canary">Canaries</a> by his front door. In one episode Stinky burned his mattress, releasing a cloud of toxic gas that surrounded the Lodge.</li>
<li>Flinty McClintock: Owner of a scrap metal yard and an "African Lion Safari" which mostly consists of snow fences and a lion so lazy and out of shape it might be a deformed pig.</li>
<li>Buster Hadfield: An extremely lazy divorcee who once spent more time at the Lodge than at home, precipitating his divorce. His daughter Susie once stole Harold's lunch money, but it was latter found that she might have feelings for Harold, which of course when nowhere.</li>
<li>Wally Kibler: The Mayor of Possom Lake.</li>
<li>Fuzzy Norton: A character rarely mentioned and thus poorly defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acorn Media has released portions of <i>The Red Green Show</i> on DVD in Region 1 in various incarnations.</p>
<p>In 2002–2003, they released six compilation DVDs labeled as "Stuffed and Mounted" volumes 1 through 6. Each DVD contains episodes from various seasons of the show up to season 10 (the most current season at the time these DVDs were released). However, there were no episodes from season two. These DVDs feature a spoken-word introduction by Steve Smith (out of character, as evidenced by his higher-pitched voice).</p>
<p>In 2006, Acorn began to release the series on DVD in complete season sets. Of note, the releases are identified by year, not season number; thus the 7th season is labeled as "1997 Season", the 8th season is "1998 Season", and so on.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Seasons 7 through 11 were released in this format.</p>
<p>In 2010, Acorn changed formats again, they began releasing compilation sets which contain episodes from multiple seasons all grouped together. The first release- <i>The Red Green Show: The Infantile Years</i> features all 72 episodes from the first 3 seasons in a 9 disc set. Extras include introductions by Steve Smith and Red &amp; Harold character biographies.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Seasons 4 through 6 were released in <i>The Red Green Show: The Toddlin' Years</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Seasons 7 through 9 were released in <i>The Red Green Show: The Delinquent Years</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Seasons 10 through 12 were released in <i>The Red Green Show: The Midlife Crisis Years</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> On 20 September 2011, Acorn released <i>The Red Green Show: The Geezer Years</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> which contains episodes from the final three seasons (13–15).</p>
